## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a Smart Crop Advisory System that integrates AI, IoT, and multilingual support to deliver actionable insights directly to farmers. Farmers can access personalized recommendations based on soil type, crop stage, and local weather through a mobile app, WhatsApp bot, or community kiosk. The system also includes image-based pest/disease detection, fertilizer recommendations, and market price tracking. Voice-based advisory in regional languages ensures accessibility for low-literate farmers. The uniqueness lies in its offline-first approach, edge AI for diagnosis, and community-driven knowledge sharing, making it both scalable and inclusive.

## Technical Approach
Mobile App / Chatbot: Multilingual, with text + voice support.

AI Models: TensorFlow Lite for on-device pest/disease detection.

IoT Sensors: Soil moisture, pH, and micro-weather tracking (ESP32/LoRa).

Backend: Node.js + Firebase for sync and storage.

User Access Points: Mobile phones, agri-kiosks, WhatsApp/IVR.

**Implementation Flow:**

Farmer inputs query (voice/image/text).

AI model + sensor data + weather API generate localized advisory.

Advisory delivered via app, voice call, or kiosk in local language.

Feedback collected for continuous improvement.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: Low-cost sensors and mobile-first solutions make it practical for rural areas. Offline-first design ensures usability even in low-connectivity zones.

Challenges: Adoption barriers due to trust issues, digital literacy, and hardware availability.

Mitigation: Partner with government (Punjab agriculture department), FPOs, and local cooperatives for awareness campaigns and kiosk setup. Voice-first design solves literacy challenges.

## Impact and Benefits
Social: Empowers farmers with reliable, scientific advisory in their own language.

Economic: Optimized input use reduces costs, improves yield, and boosts farmer income.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable farming by reducing overuse of fertilizers/pesticides.

Government & NGOs: Scalable platform for agricultural extension programs.
