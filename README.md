## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a Smart Crop Advisory System that integrates AI, IoT, and multilingual support to deliver actionable insights directly to farmers. Farmers can access personalized recommendations based on soil type, crop stage, and local weather through a mobile app, WhatsApp bot, or community kiosk. The system also includes image-based pest/disease detection, fertilizer recommendations, and market price tracking. Voice-based advisory in regional languages ensures accessibility for low-literate farmers. The uniqueness lies in its offline-first approach, edge AI for diagnosis, and community-driven knowledge sharing, making it both scalable and inclusive.

## Technical Approach
1. Data Collection Layer

IoT Sensors: Soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity, and nutrient sensors installed in fields.

Satellite & Drone Data: Remote sensing for crop health, pest detection, and water stress mapping.

External APIs: Weather forecast, market prices, and government agriculture schemes.

Farmer Inputs: Query-based input (voice, image, or text in local language) via mobile app, call center, or community kiosk.

2. Data Integration & Processing

Cloud-based Data Hub: Collects and stores sensor, satellite, and farmer input data.

Edge Computing: For offline-first advisory in villages with poor internet.

ETL Pipelines: Pre-processing raw data (cleaning, feature extraction, normalization).

Interoperability: APIs to integrate with existing platforms like eNAM, KisanSuvidha, or FPO networks.

3. AI/ML Advisory Engine

Crop Recommendation Models: Based on soil type, past crop cycles, and weather patterns.

Pest & Disease Detection: Image recognition using CNNs (farmers upload crop photos).

Yield Prediction: ML regression models trained on historical yield and climatic conditions.

Input Optimization: Recommends right quantity of fertilizer, pesticide, and irrigation to reduce costs and improve sustainability.

Market Linkage Module: Suggests the best time and place to sell produce for higher profit.

4. Farmer-Centric Advisory Delivery

Mobile Application: Multilingual, voice-assisted, low-data usage interface.

IVR / Chatbot: For farmers with feature phones.

Agri-Kiosks / Village Centers: Solar-powered devices with advisory dashboards.

Community Radio & WhatsApp Groups: For mass advisories (pest outbreak alerts, rainfall warnings).

5. Feedback & Continuous Learning

Farmer Feedback Loop: Farmers confirm effectiveness of advisory.

Reinforcement Learning: AI models continuously improve with new field data.

Community Moderation: Farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing integrated with system insights.

6. Security, Privacy & Scalability

Data Security: Role-based access, encryption for farmer data.

Scalable Architecture: Cloud-native microservices for expansion across regions.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: Low-cost sensors and mobile-first solutions make it practical for rural areas. Offline-first design ensures usability even in low-connectivity zones.

Challenges: Adoption barriers due to trust issues, digital literacy, and hardware availability.

Mitigation: Partner with government (Punjab agriculture department), FPOs, and local cooperatives for awareness campaigns and kiosk setup. Voice-first design solves literacy challenges.

## Impact and Benefits
Social: Empowers farmers with reliable, scientific advisory in their own language.

Economic: Optimized input use reduces costs, improves yield, and boosts farmer income.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable farming by reducing overuse of fertilizers/pesticides.

Government & NGOs: Scalable platform for agricultural extension programs.
